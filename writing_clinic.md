# Writing & Presentation Clinic

In this clinic we focus on **communicating science clearly** — in both writing and presentations.  
The goal is to reflect on how we tell the story of our research through **titles, abstracts, figure captions**, and **talks**, and to practice giving and receiving feedback that makes our communication sharper and more engaging.

## Focus
- **Good writing:** what makes scientific writing clear, precise, and readable.  
  - Reflections and anecdotes on rewriting, iteration, and lessons learned from mentors — the value of reworking abstracts and refining figure captions.  
- **Good presentations:** what makes a talk effective — structure, pacing, visuals, and narrative flow.

## Activity
- **Before class:** groups should have a solid draft of their paper. It doesn’t need to be perfect, but titles, abstracts, and figure captions should be in good shape for discussion.  
- **In class:** students share their work and give one another direct, constructive feedback focused on clarity, coherence, and storytelling.
