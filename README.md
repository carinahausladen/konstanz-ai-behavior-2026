## 📖 Course Description

This course examines four cutting-edge topics at the intersection of computational methods and social science. Each theme is grounded in recent research, showcasing innovative approaches to understanding human behavior and their implications for AI and large language model (LLM) alignment.  

Students will not only learn the methods and findings from these papers but also develop the ability to critically assess, replicate, and extend them. The course emphasizes independent research skills, preparing students for future work in academia or industry.  

A central component is the semester-long group project, where students will replicate, extend, or reinterpret existing research, culminating in a final presentation and paper.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:  

### Research Design
- Formulate a research question and design a project that replicates, extends, or reinterprets existing studies in computational social science.  
- Plan a structured research process, including proposal, code development, and paper preparation.  

### Data Collection and Analysis
- Implement computational methods such as clustering, reinforcement learning, and causal analysis to address complex behavioral and AI-related questions.  
- Process and analyze data from experiments, simulations, or model outputs using appropriate metrics and evaluation techniques.  

### Research-Based Transfer
- Interpret research findings in light of broader debates on fairness, alignment, and social choice in AI.  
- Communicate results effectively through presentations and writing, connecting technical insights to societal and ethical implications.
