# Modeling Social Dilemmas through Reinforcement Learning

This lecture explores how social dilemma games help us understand cooperation and conflict in human decision-making. 
We connect ideas from behavioral economics and machine learning to study how people adapt their strategies over time. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework for modeling these adaptive behaviors, while inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) helps infer the motivations behind observed choices.

## ðŸ“˜ Lecture Notes

- Social Dilemma Games
   - Situations with conflict between individual and collective interest.  
   - Examples: Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma, Stag Hunt, Public Goods Game.  
   - Cooperation vs. defection as emergent dynamics.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
   - Agents learn from rewards and punishments over time.  
   - Focus on adaptation rather than fixed rational strategies.
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
   - Formalism for sequential decision-making under uncertainty.  
   - States, actions, transitions, rewards.  
   - Provides the backbone for repeated social dilemma modeling.
- Q-Learning
   - Core algorithm of RL.  
   - Learns stateâ€“action values through trial and error.  
   - Simple but powerful: applies to small matrix games and large-scale AI systems.
- Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
   - From observed choices, infer the hidden reward function.  
   - Useful in social science: recover fairness concerns, reciprocity, inequality aversion.
