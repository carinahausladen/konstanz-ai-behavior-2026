# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reinforcement Learning in Social Dilemmas


Reinforcement learning is one of the core paradigms of computer science: it underpins many of the breakthroughs in modern AI, from AlphaGo to robotics to large language model alignment. For the social sciences, RL offers a way to study how agents actually behave and adapt over time, rather than assuming perfect rationality. The two core papers in this block show how RL can be used to model cooperation in resource dilemmas and even design mechanisms for fairer, more sustainable policies. Mastering RL therefore means bridging two worlds ‚Äî agent-based simulation in the social sciences and a foundational concept in computer science.

## üîë Core Concepts

1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
   - Agents learn from rewards and punishments over time.  
   - Focus on adaptation rather than fixed rational strategies.  

2. **Q-Learning**
   - Core algorithm of RL.  
   - Learns state‚Äìaction values through trial and error.  
   - Simple but powerful: applies to small matrix games and large-scale AI systems.  

3. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
   - Formalism for sequential decision-making under uncertainty.  
   - States, actions, transitions, rewards.  
   - Provides the backbone for repeated social dilemma modeling.  

4. **Social Dilemma Games**
   - Situations with conflict between individual and collective interest.  
   - Examples: Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma, Stag Hunt, Public Goods Game.  
   - Cooperation vs. defection as emergent dynamics.  

5. **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)**
   - From observed choices, infer the hidden reward function.  
   - Useful in social science: recover fairness concerns, reciprocity, inequality aversion.  

6. **Emergent Cooperation & Defection**
   - Outcomes depend on learning rates, exploration strategies, and discounting.  
   - RL explains why cooperation sometimes stabilizes, sometimes collapses.
