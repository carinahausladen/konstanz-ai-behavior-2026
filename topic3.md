# Social Choice for LLM Alignment

---

This lecture explores how individual preferences can be elicited and aggregated to make collective decisions fairly and proportionally — from voting and participatory budgeting to modern AI systems that learn from human feedback.
We connect classical social choice theory with human-centered AI, showing how the same principles of fairness and representation guide both democratic and computational decision-making.
